An example to use R to process large datasets, infer business intelligence and build business applications.\r\n\r\n## Live App for Demo\r\nA deployed version of this repo is available at [TimeFlies Shiny App](http://godata.xyz:3838/apps/timeFlies/)\r\n\r\n## Data Source\r\nThis version uses publicly available data from\r\n- [US Department of Transportation](http://www.transtats.bts.gov/DL_SelectFields.asp?Table_ID=236)\r\n\r\n- [IATA Codes](http://iatacodes.org/)\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\nThis repo doesn't contain the data files supporting the app but does have all the scripts to download, transform, and produce such data files.\r\n\r\n### System requirements\r\n- A computer with at least 1G RAM and 8G disk space installed with R and Sqlite\r\n- The app is designed to be viewed in computer web browsers rather than on mobile devices, even though the web pages do respect responsive design as much as possible\r\n- My R `sessionInfo()` info as below:\r\n\r\n```R\r\nR version 3.3.0 (2016-05-03)\r\nPlatform: x86_64-pc-linux-gnu (64-bit)\r\nRunning under: Ubuntu 14.04.4 LTS\r\n\r\nlocale:\r\n [1] LC_CTYPE=en_US.UTF-8       LC_NUMERIC=C               LC_TIME=en_US.UTF-8       \r\n [4] LC_COLLATE=en_US.UTF-8     LC_MONETARY=en_US.UTF-8    LC_MESSAGES=en_US.UTF-8   \r\n [7] LC_PAPER=en_US.UTF-8       LC_NAME=C                  LC_ADDRESS=C              \r\n[10] LC_TELEPHONE=C             LC_MEASUREMENT=en_US.UTF-8 LC_IDENTIFICATION=C       \r\n\r\nattached base packages:\r\n[1] stats     graphics  grDevices utils     datasets  methods   base     \r\n\r\nother attached packages:\r\n [1] splitstackshape_1.4.2 data.table_1.9.6      tidyr_0.5.1           dplyr_0.4.3          \r\n [5] plotly_3.6.0          ggthemes_3.0.3        ggplot2_2.1.0         googleVis_0.5.10     \r\n [9] shinydashboard_0.5.1  shiny_0.13.2         \r\n\r\nloaded via a namespace (and not attached):\r\n [1] Rcpp_0.12.5      magrittr_1.5     munsell_0.4.3    colorspace_1.2-6 xtable_1.8-2     R6_2.1.2        \r\n [7] httr_1.2.0       plyr_1.8.4       tools_3.3.0      parallel_3.3.0   grid_3.3.0       gtable_0.2.0    \r\n[13] DBI_0.4-1        htmltools_0.3.5  digest_0.6.9     assertthat_0.1   RJSONIO_1.3-0    gridExtra_2.2.1 \r\n[19] viridis_0.3.4    base64enc_0.1-3  htmlwidgets_0.6  mime_0.4         scales_0.4.0     jsonlite_0.9.22 \r\n[25] chron_2.3-47     httpuv_1.3.3  \r\n```\r\n\r\n### Setup\r\n1.
